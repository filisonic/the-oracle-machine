# Media assets for The Oracle Machine

## Images → `assets/images/`

- **Hero background** (behind the title): name it **`hero-bg.jpg`**. Shown at very low opacity; keep the image high‑resolution and avoid busy detail.

- **Main installation video** (watch-and-read section): the site uses **video** from `assets/videos/installation.mp4`. We recommend **keeping the MP4** here—it usually loads faster and looks better than a GIF. If you prefer to use a **GIF** instead, put it in **`assets/images/installation.gif`** and we can switch that block to an `<img>` tag (GIFs belong in the images folder).

- **Gallery** (carousel on main page): put photos in **`assets/images/gallery/`** named **`1.jpg`**, **`2.jpg`**, **`3.jpg`**, … Add or remove slides in the Gallery section in `index.html` to match how many you have.

## Videos → `assets/videos/`

- **Installation video** (plays on the main page beside the text): name it **`installation.mp4`**. It autoplays muted and loops. Prefer MP4 over GIF for smaller file size and better quality.
